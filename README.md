# BoomBikes-Prediction_Model
## Problem Statement

The Bike Demand Prediction Project tackles the challenges confronted by BoomBikes, a bike-sharing service provider, amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The company has witnessed a substantial decline in its revenue streams, prompting the need for a data-driven strategy to reinvigorate its business once normalcy returns. The primary objective of this project is to predict and gain insights into the demand for shared bikes in the American market, leveraging various factors that influence this demand.

### Context

BoomBikes, a prominent bike-sharing provider, is experiencing financial hardships due to the prolonged impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. With lockdowns and restrictions affecting people's mobility, the company's business operations have suffered greatly. In preparation for a post-pandemic resurgence and economic recovery, BoomBikes has enlisted the expertise of a consulting firm to conduct a comprehensive analysis. The company's leadership is keen to understand the factors that underpin bike rental demand, particularly in the American market. The primary objectives are as follows:

1. **Variable Significance**: Identify and quantify the significance of variables that play a crucial role in predicting bike demand.

2. **Demand Dynamics**: Comprehend how these significant variables interplay to influence bike rental demand patterns.

3. **Predictive Modeling**: Develop robust predictive models that can accurately forecast bike rental demand under varying conditions.

## Summary

The Bike Demand Prediction Project encompasses an array of analytical and modeling techniques to address BoomBikes' challenges and objectives. The project journey unfolds as follows:

1. **Data Exploration**: Extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted to gain a deep understanding of the dataset. The analysis involves identifying trends, patterns, correlations, and outliers, which serve as valuable insights for subsequent modeling.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Data preprocessing is a critical step in data preparation. This phase involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to ensure data quality and compatibility for modeling.

3. **Model Building**: The project leverages various regression models, with a particular focus on linear regression, to predict bike demand based on the available features. Machine learning algorithms are employed to capture intricate relationships within the data.

4. **Model Evaluation**: Model performance is rigorously evaluated using a range of metrics, including R-squared, mean squared error (MSE), and visualizations such as Q-Q plots to validate assumptions. The aim is to ensure that the models are reliable and robust.

5. **Feature Importance**: Feature importance analysis is conducted to identify the key factors that exert a significant influence on bike rental demand. This insight aids in making informed strategic decisions.

## Key Findings

The Bike Demand Prediction Project has yielded noteworthy findings that have practical implications for BoomBikes:

1. **Weather Conditions Matter**: Weather conditions, including temperature, play a pivotal role in bike demand. Riders are more inclined to rent bikes during pleasant weather conditions, such as spring and clear skies.

2. **Seasonal Patterns**: Seasonal variations significantly impact bike demand. Spring emerges as a prime opportunity for business expansion, while demand tends to dip during the winter and spring seasons.

3. **Yearly Trends**: The year 2019 is anticipated to witness a surge in demand compared to 2018. This suggests that once the situation normalizes, a substantial increase in users is expected.

4. **Weather-Induced Variability**: Adverse weather conditions, such as light snow or rain, lead to reduced bookings. These periods could be leveraged for bike servicing without incurring a significant impact on business.

5. **Key Predictive Features**: The analysis highlights temperature, weather conditions (particularly light snow), and the year as the top features contributing significantly to bike rental demand.

These findings empower BoomBikes with actionable insights to formulate effective strategies, optimize services, and bolster revenue in anticipation of a post-pandemic market resurgence.
